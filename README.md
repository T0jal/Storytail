# Storytail  - Virtual Library Management System

This project was created as a Final Group Project of a full-stack programming degree.

The client asked for a WebApp that would allow Users to not only read books, but also hear the pages being narrated and have the possibility of watching a video.

The main technologies used were the Laravel Framework and Vue.js.

The WebApp is divided into 2 parts:

- Backoffice -> Accessible by the Admin and where he can control de App. It has a complete CRUD for books, authors, activities, images, etc. The front-end of the backoffice was made using Laravel Blade Templates and Bootstrap.
- Frontoffice -> Accessible by all and where the books can be read/heard. The User also has access to an editable profile page. This is a SPA made with Vue.js that consumes our Laravel API. Original CSS.
